## Working with face recognition with using OpenCV.

# Testing the camera:
python simple_cam_test.py.

# Face detection from camera:
python face_detection/face_detection.py.

# Face recognition of concrete person:
1. Create a dataset of faces of concrete persons: python concrete_face_recognition/face_dataset_1.py.
2. Process of training: python concrete_face_recognition/face_training_2.py.
3. Face recognition of concrete person from camera: python concrete_face_recognition/face_recognition_3.py.
